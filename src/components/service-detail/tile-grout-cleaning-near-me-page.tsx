const NEAR_ME_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Lerwick in Shetland and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new coverage areas every month and may already have a tile and grout cleaning technician near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local tile and grout technician start?",
    a: "From quote to clean in under 48 hours for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 5-7 working days for technician routing and travel planning. Same-day starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Commercial and trade enquiries get a same-day response.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the technician travel to me, or do I need to bring the tiles to you?",
    a: "All tile and grout cleaning is performed on-site at your property &mdash; we never transport your floor anywhere. Our crews arrive in fully-equipped vans with high-pressure extraction tools, pH-appropriate chemistry, grout recolour in 12 shades, and sealing materials. The only exception is small items like loose hearth tiles, which can be brought to our workshop for specialist Victorian tile restoration if required.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have tile and grout technicians available in rural Scotland?",
    a: "Yes. We cover rural Scotland including Perthshire, Angus, Fife, the Borders, Argyll, Aberdeenshire, and parts of the Highlands. For very remote properties (Islands, far North), we may operate on a minimum-area basis or schedule combined visits with neighbouring properties to keep travel costs down. Call us to discuss your specific location &mdash; we&rsquo;ll always give you a straight answer on coverage and lead time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you restore the Victorian tiles in my tenement hallway?",
    a: "Absolutely &mdash; Victorian encaustic tile restoration is one of our specialities, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow tenement hallways. These tiles are 100+ years old, often laid on a lime-bed, and require a hand-cleaning approach with minimal water, neutral pH cleaner, soft brushes, and a topical sealer to restore the depth of colour. We have restored dozens of tenement hallways across Scotland &mdash; references available on request, and before-and-after photos from recent projects.",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between tile cleaning and grout recolouring near me?",
    a: "Tile cleaning uses high-pressure hot-water extraction (800-1,200 PSI for ceramic/porcelain, 300-500 PSI for natural stone) with an alkaline pre-spray to physically flush dissolved soil out of the grout joint &mdash; in 90% of cases, the grout returns to its original colour. Grout recolouring goes one step further: we apply a pigmented sealer in 1 of 12 standard shades that re-colours the grout to a uniform appearance regardless of the underlying stain, and protects it for 3-5 years. We recommend recolouring for heavily stained grout where extraction alone won&rsquo;t fully restore the original colour.",
