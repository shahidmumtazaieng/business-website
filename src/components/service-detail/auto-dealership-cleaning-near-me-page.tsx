Whether you&rsquo;re searching for early-morning pre-opening showroom resets at a Glasgow Braehead main dealer, evening end-of-day workshop degreasing at an Edinburgh Newbridge EV showroom, weekend turnover support at an Aberdeen Lang Stracht used car superstore, or franchise-audit-compliance deep cleans at a Dundee Clepington Road dealership, we assign a vetted, PAYE-employed crew that stays with you for the long run.

We develop a tailored RAMS package (Risk Assessments and Method Statements) and Safe Systems of Work for your dealership&rsquo;s unique operational needs. We send an itemised proposal within 2 business days: crew size, visit frequency, time on-site, scope of work, fixed monthly rate, RAMS, COSHH datasheets, and a draft cleaning schedule.

  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Inverness in the Highlands and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new dealership coverage areas every month and may already have a vetted uniformed PVG-checked crew near you. Our local auto dealership cleaning crews operate across Glasgow&rsquo;s Braehead, Hillington and Cambuslang (main dealer groups and used car superstores), Edinburgh&rsquo;s Newbridge, Sighthill and Fort Kinnaird (premium main dealers and EV showrooms), Aberdeen&rsquo;s Lang Stracht and Westhill (main dealers and motor trade), Dundee&rsquo;s Clepington Road and Kingsway (used car superstores and independent dealers), and Scottish dealership districts across the Central Belt.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local dealership cleaning crew start?",
    a: "From free site survey and itemised quote to first clean in 5&ndash;7 working days for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 7&ndash;10 working days for crew routing, equipment mobilisation, and travel planning. Same-week starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. New showroom launches, post-refurbishment reopens, EV showroom openings, and franchise audit prep typically schedule 2&ndash;3 weeks out to allow for full site survey, proposal, mobilisation, crew onboarding, and equipment delivery across every zone of your premises.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the crew travel to my dealership, or do I need to bring anything to you?",
    a: "All auto dealership &amp; car showroom cleaning is performed on-site at your premises &mdash; we never transport anything off-site. Our crews arrive in liveried vans with HEPA-filtered vacuums for showroom floor dust, industrial scrubber-driers (Karcher, Truvox) for polished concrete and tiled showroom floor restoration, high-speed burnishers for periodic showroom floor buffing, specialist tyre-mark removers for display-vehicle tyre marks on tiled and polished concrete, industrial degreasers for workshop service bays and MOT bay floors, oil-absorbent granules for spill response in workshop areas, professional chrome polish for taps, towel rails, display cabinet hardware, and customer lounge fixtures, streak-free automotive glass cleaner for partitions, mirrors, and entrance door glass, microfibre systems (folded to multiple faces) for paintwork-safe wipe-downs on display vehicles, HSE-compliant chemicals with COSHH datasheets, PPE, and non-toxic, child-safe, surface-safe chemistry. You provide consumables (bin liners, paper towel, toilet paper, hand soap, sanitiser wipes) or we can manage consumable restocking for an additional monthly fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have dealership cleaning crews experienced with paintwork-safe detailing, franchise audit compliance, and workshop degreasing?",
    a: "Yes. Our crews are trained specifically on auto dealership &amp; car showroom protocols &mdash; HSE compliance, RAMS as standard, Safe Systems of Work, showroom floor restoration (dust-mop, machine-scrub, high-speed buff), paintwork-safe wipe-downs on display vehicles (microfibre cloths folded to multiple faces, wipe in one direction, never circular), specialist tyre-mark removers on tiled and polished concrete showroom floors, industrial degreasers for workshop service bays and MOT bay floors, oil-absorbent granules for spill response, professional chrome polish for taps and fixtures, streak-free automotive glass cleaner for partitions and entrance glazing, customer lounge upholstery care, franchise audit compliance documentation, and audit-ready signed cleaning logs. We provide audit-ready signed cleaning logs, COSHH datasheets, RAMS, training records, vetting records (PVG), and &pound;5m public liability certificates (covering damage to display vehicles, which can be worth &pound;100,000+) for your compliance file. We currently service main dealer groups in Glasgow&rsquo;s Braehead and Hillington, premium main dealers in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Newbridge, EV showrooms across the Central Belt, used car superstores in Aberdeen&rsquo;s Lang Stracht, and independent dealers in Dundee&rsquo;s Clepington Road.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you handle secure access, alarm systems, and out-of-hours cleaning at my dealership?",
    a: "Absolutely. We&rsquo;re trained on all major alarm systems (Texecom, Honeywell, Pyronix, Risco) and follow strict key-handling protocols: keys stored in a coded safe between visits, alarm codes encrypted and only released to your assigned crew lead, never labelled with your address. We hold &pound;5m public liability as standard (covering damage to display vehicles, which can be worth &pound;100,000+) &mdash; full employer&rsquo;s liability, professional indemnity, and contingent employer&rsquo;s liability, suitable for main dealerships, used car superstores, EV showrooms, and independent dealers. The most common windows are pre-opening resets (typically 6&ndash;8am before the showroom opens) for showroom floors, glass partitions, display vehicle wipe-downs, reception, and customer lounge; between-handover touch-ups for high-traffic reception and customer lounge areas during the day; and end-of-day deep cleans (typically 7&ndash;11pm after the last customer leaves) for workshop service bays, amenity blocks, customer restrooms, and back-of-house. We can also split: light touch during the day (between-handover touch-ups on high-traffic welfare areas), full deep clean after hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between pre-opening resets, between-handover touch-ups, and end-of-day deep cleans near me?",
    a: "Pre-opening resets (typically 6&ndash;8am before the showroom opens) are the right choice for showroom floors, glass partitions, display vehicle wipe-downs, reception, and customer lounge where the cumulative load from the previous day is too high for less frequent visits &mdash; the crew becomes part of your morning routine. Between-handover touch-ups suit high-traffic reception and customer lounge areas where the daily contamination load is manageable but steady &mdash; glass partitions refreshed, customer lounge seating plumped, reception desk wiped, coffee machine and water dispenser sanitised between handovers. End-of-day deep cleans (typically 7&ndash;11pm after the last customer leaves) cover workshop service bays, amenity blocks, customer restrooms, and back-of-house &mdash; the full reset that protects your finishes, your air quality, and your compliance file. We can also split: light touch during the day (between-handover touch-ups on high-traffic welfare areas), full deep clean after hours. We&rsquo;ve handled turnaround windows as tight as 30 minutes between handovers and surge mobilisations for new showroom launches, EV showroom openings, and post-refurbishment reopens. Your account manager will advise on the best schedule for your specific dealership type, capacity, and sales calendar.",

              Maundy Clean is a Scottish auto dealership &amp; car showroom cleaning
              company built on the Maundy tradition of service and care. We don&rsquo;t
              operate as an impersonal national franchise &mdash; we&rsquo;re a local
              specialist with vetted, uniformed, PVG-checked crews living and working in
              your area. Whether you&rsquo;re searching for early-morning pre-opening
              showroom resets at a Glasgow Braehead main dealer, evening end-of-day
              workshop degreasing at an Edinburgh Newbridge EV showroom, weekend
              turnover support at an Aberdeen Lang Stracht used car superstore, or
              franchise-audit-compliance deep cleans at a Dundee Clepington Road
              dealership, we assign a vetted, PAYE-employed crew that stays with you for
              the long run. Same crew, same standard, same locked-in rate for 12 months.
