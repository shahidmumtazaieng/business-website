const NEAR_ME_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Lerwick in Shetland and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new coverage areas every month and may already have a floor care specialist near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local floor care specialist start?",
    a: "From quote to clean in under 48 hours for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 5-7 working days for technician routing and travel planning. Same-day starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Full strip-and-refinish bookings typically schedule 1-2 weeks out to allow for polish curing; full diamond-grit restoration typically 2-3 weeks out to allow for multi-day honing through 50-grit to 3000-grit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the technician travel to me, or do I need to bring the floor to you?",
    a: "All floor care and restoration is performed on-site at your property &mdash; we never transport your floor anywhere. Our crews arrive in fully-equipped vans with low-speed rotary machines, high-speed burnishers, diamond-grit honing systems, HEPA-filtered dust extractors, professional wet/dry vacuums, air movers, gloss meters, colour-coded pad systems, and chemistry matched to every floor type. The only exception is small loose items like oak off-cuts or marble tile samples, which can be brought to our workshop for colour-matching.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have floor care specialists available in rural Scotland?",
    a: "Yes. We cover rural Scotland including Perthshire, Angus, Fife, the Borders, Argyll, Aberdeenshire, and parts of the Highlands. For very remote properties (Islands, far North), we may operate on a minimum-area basis or schedule combined visits with neighbouring properties to keep travel costs down. Call us to discuss your specific location &mdash; we&rsquo;ll always give you a straight answer on coverage and lead time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you sand the original pine boards in my Edinburgh tenement?",
    a: "Absolutely &mdash; original tenement pine board restoration is one of our specialities, particularly in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Marchmont, Bruntsfield, Stockbridge, and New Town areas. These boards are typically 100-130 years old, often covered in old varnish, paint splashes, and decades of wear. We sand them back to beautiful golden pine using L&auml;gler Hummel drum sanders with Festool HEPA dust extraction (virtually dust-free), and finish with Osmo Polyx-Oil or Bona Traffic HD lacquer. References and before-and-after photos from recent Edinburgh tenement projects available on request.",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between scrub-and-recoat, full strip-and-refinish, and diamond-grit restoration near me?",
    a: "Scrub-and-recoat (&pound;4/m&sup2;) is the quarterly top-up &mdash; light scrub with red pad and neutral cleaner, 2 top-up coats of metal-interlock polish, 12-hour cure. Extends polish life by 6-12 months. Full strip-and-refinish (&pound;12/m&sup2;) is the annual cycle for high-traffic VCT, linoleum, and rubber &mdash; full strip back to bare floor, 4-6 coats of high-solids polish, 24-hour cure. Diamond-grit restoration (&pound;28/m&sup2;) is the natural stone, terrazzo, and sealed concrete protocol &mdash; 50-grit through 3000-grit honing, crystallisation or densifier, impregnating sealer, mirror finish. We&rsquo;ll recommend the right approach at the free floor analysis.",
