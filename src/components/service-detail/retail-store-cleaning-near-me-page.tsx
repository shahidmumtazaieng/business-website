const NEAR_ME_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Inverness in the Highlands and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new retail coverage areas every month and may already have a retail store cleaning crew near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local retail cleaning crew start?",
    a: "From site survey to first clean in 5-7 working days for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 7-10 working days for crew routing and travel planning. Same-week starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Large multi-unit retail contracts typically schedule 3-4 weeks out to allow for full site survey, proposal, mobilisation, and crew onboarding across every store.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the crew travel to my shop, or do I need to bring anything to you?",
    a: "All retail store cleaning is performed on-site at your premises &mdash; we never transport anything off-site. Our crews arrive in liveried vans with commercial-grade vacuums (Sebo BS36/BS46, Henry HVR200), microfibre flat-mop systems, colour-coded cloths (red for toilets, blue for sinks, green for staff kitchen, yellow for shop floor), HSE-compliant chemicals with COSHH datasheets, PPE, squeegees for windows and mirrors, and EN 1276 food-safe bactericidal chemistry for till-zone disinfection. You provide consumables &mdash; bin liners, paper towel, toilet paper, hand soap &mdash; or we can manage consumable restocking for an additional monthly fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have retail cleaning crews available in shopping centres and retail parks?",
    a: "Yes. We are experienced with the larger-format floorplates, the higher foot-fall at weekends, the shared-service-charge models, and the strict out-of-hours access windows typical of shopping centre and retail park management. We can clean common areas (mall walkways, customer WCs, food court) as part of a landlord service charge arrangement, and individual retail units as separate tenancy contracts. We are an approved contractor at major Scottish shopping centres including Silverburn, Braehead, The Centre in Livingston, Glasgow Fort, and Fort Kinnaird.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you handle secure access, alarm systems, and out-of-hours cleaning at my store?",
    a: "Absolutely. We&rsquo;re trained on all major alarm systems (Texecom, Honeywell, Pyronix, Risco) and follow strict key-handling protocols: keys stored in a coded safe between visits, alarm codes encrypted and only released to your assigned crew lead, never labelled with your address. We hold &pound;5m public liability cover and &pound;5m employer&rsquo;s liability cover &mdash; suitable for high-street units, shopping centre tenancies, and retail park stores. The most common windows are pre-open (6am-8am) for a front-line ready reset, post-close (7pm-10pm) for a full deep turnover, or split schedules (light touch during trading, deep clean after hours).",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between daily open & close, weekly, and after-hours retail cleaning near me?",
    a: "Daily open and close cleaning (typically 60-120 minutes per visit, Monday-Sunday) is the right choice for high-footfall retail stores, food retailers, and any store where customers are in constant contact with surfaces &mdash; the cumulative soil load is too high for less frequent visits. Weekly cleaning suits smaller boutiques, low-traffic independent shops, or showrooms with appointment-only traffic. After-hours cleaning means your crew works when your customers and staff aren&rsquo;t there &mdash; typically 7pm-10pm or 6am-8am &mdash; giving them the empty space they need to do a proper job without vacuuming around shoppers. We can also split: light touch during the day (fitting room and till zone refresh every couple of hours), deep clean after hours. Your account manager will advise on the best schedule for your specific footprint, density, and trading hours.",
