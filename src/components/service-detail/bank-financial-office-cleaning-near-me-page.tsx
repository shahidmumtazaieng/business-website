PCI-DSS scope is mapped, GDPR requirements are documented, keyholding protocol is established, sign-in/out procedure is agreed, and a site-specific protocol document is drafted and signed off by both parties. We send an itemised proposal within 2 business days: crew size, visit frequency, time on-site, scope of work, fixed monthly rate, and a draft cleaning schedule.

const NEAR_ME_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Inverness in the Highlands and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new bank and financial office coverage areas every month and may already have a vetted uniformed security-cleared crew near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local bank cleaning crew start?",
    a: "From site survey and security assessment to first clean in 5-7 working days for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 7-10 working days for crew routing and travel planning. Same-week starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Large multi-branch bank and financial institution contracts typically schedule 3-4 weeks out to allow for full site survey, proposal, mobilisation, PCI-DSS training, and crew onboarding across every site.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the crew travel to my branch, or do I need to bring anything to you?",
    a: "All bank and financial office cleaning is performed on-site at your premises &mdash; we never transport anything off-site. Our crews arrive in liveried vans with commercial-grade HEPA-filtered vacuums (Sebo BS36/BS46, Henry HVR200), microfibre flat-mop systems with separate dirty-water extraction, colour-coded cloths (red for high-contamination touchpoints like ATM keypads and door handles, green for member-facing surfaces like teller counters, yellow for washroom and kitchenette, blue for executive-suite and boardroom), HSE-compliant chemicals with COSHH datasheets, PPE, squeegees for windows and mirrors, anti-static cloths and a CRN-rated HEPA vacuum for server-room use, 180&deg;C dry-steam sanitizers for tile, grout, and chrome, and EN 14476 virucidal disinfectant with a verified 60-second contact time for every ATM keypad, payment terminal, card-reader slot, and teller-counter surface. You provide consumables (bin liners, paper towel, toilet paper, hand soap, sanitiser wipes) or we can manage consumable restocking for an additional monthly fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have bank cleaning crews experienced with PCI-DSS-aware, GDPR-aligned protocols and dual-control keyholding?",
    a: "Yes. Our security-cleared crews are trained specifically on banking and financial services protocols &mdash; PCI-DSS-aware (no unattended desks touched, no screens photographed, no USB devices handled, no paperwork removed, no cardholder-data zones entered unsupervised), GDPR-aligned (locked-console shredding emptied only by the contracted provider, desk-side open bins only for general waste, operatives trained to identify personal data on sight and leave it untouched), and dual-control keyholding for vault, strongroom, safety-deposit box areas, and cash-handling zones (our operative never enters these zones alone &mdash; always accompanied by a designated member of branch staff). We provide audit-ready signed cleaning logs, keyholder registers, key-movement logs, training records, COSHH datasheets, vetting records (DBS/PVG), and &pound;10m public liability certificates for your compliance file and your QSA audit. We currently service 18 high-street bank branches, four building society HQs, six wealth-management offices, and five fintech workspaces across Scotland, including two premium private-banking suites and three insurance-company head offices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you handle secure access, alarm systems, and out-of-hours cleaning at my branch?",
    a: "Absolutely. We&rsquo;re trained on all major alarm systems (Texecom, Honeywell, Pyronix, Risco) and follow strict key-handling protocols: keys stored in a coded safe between visits, alarm codes encrypted and only released to your assigned crew lead, never labelled with your address. We hold &pound;10m public liability cover for financial services contracts (higher than our standard &pound;5m), full employer&rsquo;s liability, professional indemnity, and contingent employer&rsquo;s liability &mdash; suitable for high-street bank branches, building society HQs, wealth-management offices, insurance HQs, and fintech workspaces. The most common windows are pre-open (5am-7am) for a front-line ready reset before customer trading begins, post-close (5pm-7pm) for a full deep turnover after the day&rsquo;s footfall, or full out-of-hours (10pm-midnight) service. We can also support day-porter service for high-traffic branch lobbies, ATM vestibules, and staff kitchenettes during peak trading. For vault, strongroom, and cash-handling zones, dual-control is non-negotiable &mdash; we never enter these zones alone, and we never hold vault or strongroom keys (those remain with the bank&rsquo;s own keyholders at all times).",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between daily open & close, weekly, and after-hours bank cleaning near me?",
    a: "Daily open and close cleaning (typically 60-120 minutes per visit, Monday-Sunday) is the right choice for high-footfall high-street bank branches, building society branch networks, and city-centre fintech workspaces where customers and staff are in constant contact with surfaces and the ATM vestibule is in daily use &mdash; the cumulative customer-footfall, dust, and high-touch contamination load is too high for less frequent visits. Weekly cleaning suits smaller neighbourhood building-society branches, low-traffic wealth-management offices, or private-banking suites with limited customer opening days. After-hours cleaning means your crew works when your customers and staff aren&rsquo;t there &mdash; typically 5pm-7pm or 10pm-midnight &mdash; giving them the empty space they need to do a proper job without vacuuming around customers mid-transaction or sanitising an ATM keypad mid-use. We can also split: light touch during the day (washroom checks and touchpoint wipes every couple of hours), deep clean after hours. Your account manager will advise on the best schedule for your specific footprint, density, and opening hours.",
