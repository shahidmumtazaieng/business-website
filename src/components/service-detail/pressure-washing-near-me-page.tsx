  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Lerwick in Shetland and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new coverage areas every month and may already have a pressure washing technician near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local pressure washing technician start?",
    a: "From quote to clean in under 48 hours for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 5-7 working days for technician routing and travel planning. Same-day starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Commercial and trade enquiries get a same-day response.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the technician travel to me, or do I need to bring the surface to you?",
    a: "All pressure washing is performed on-site at your property &mdash; we never transport your driveway or patio anywhere. Our crews arrive in fully-equipped vans with rotary surface cleaners, biocidal pre-treatment chemistry, sealing and re-sanding materials, and SEPA-compliant wastewater containment. We do offer a free collection-and-delivery service for delicate items like hand-knotted rugs, but for exterior pressure washing, everything happens at your property.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have pressure washing technicians available in rural Scotland?",
    a: "Yes. We cover rural Scotland including Perthshire, Angus, Fife, the Borders, Argyll, Aberdeenshire, and parts of the Highlands. For very remote properties (Islands, far North), we may operate on a minimum-area basis or schedule combined visits with neighbouring properties to keep travel costs down. Call us to discuss your specific location &mdash; we&rsquo;ll always give you a straight answer on coverage and lead time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you pressure wash my holiday let or short-term rental?",
    a: "Absolutely. Many of our clients use us for holiday lets, short-term rentals, and second homes across Scotland. We provide emergency turnover pressure washing between guests, periodic deep cleans during void periods, and full exterior restoration for premium short-term lets. Visit our Holiday Let Turnover page for more detail on combined turnover + pressure washing packages.",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between pressure washing and soft washing near me?",
    a: "Pressure washing uses high-pressure water (40-200 bar depending on substrate) to physically lift grime, moss, and staining from hard surfaces like driveways, patios, and block paving. Soft washing uses low-pressure biocidal chemistry to kill organic growth on delicate surfaces like render, limewash, and roof tiles &mdash; we never use high pressure on these substrates. We do both: rotary pressure washing for hard surfaces, and low-pressure biocidal washing for render and roof surfaces. If you have both, we&rsquo;ll quote a combined package.",
