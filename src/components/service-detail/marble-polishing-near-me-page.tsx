const NEAR_ME_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if you cover my area?",
    a: "We cover 72+ towns and cities across Scotland &mdash; from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Central Belt to Lerwick in Shetland and everywhere in between. Use the location grid above to find your town. If you don&rsquo;t see your postcode listed, call us &mdash; we add new coverage areas every month and may already have a marble polishing specialist near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a local marble specialist start?",
    a: "From quote to clean in under 48 hours for most postcodes in the Central Belt. For more remote areas (Highlands, Islands, Borders), allow 5-7 working days for technician routing and travel planning. Same-day starts are occasionally possible in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dundee &mdash; call us to check availability. Full polish-and-seal bookings typically schedule 1-2 weeks out to allow for polish curing; school-holiday strips typically schedule 4-8 weeks out to align with closure windows.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the technician travel to me, or do I need to bring the floor to you?",
    a: "All marble polishing and restoration is performed on-site at your property &mdash; we never transport your floor anywhere. Our crews arrive in fully-equipped vans with low-speed rotary machines, mechanical polishers, HEPA-filtered wet/dry vacuums, air movers, gloss meters, colour-coded pad systems, and chemistry matched to marble and adjacent natural stone surfaces. The only exception is small loose marble tile samples, which can be brought to our workshop for colour-matching against polish swatches.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have marble specialists available in rural Scotland?",
    a: "Yes. We cover rural Scotland including Perthshire, Angus, Fife, the Borders, Argyll, Aberdeenshire, and parts of the Highlands. For very remote properties (Islands, far North), we may operate on a minimum-area basis or schedule combined visits with neighbouring properties to keep travel costs down. Call us to discuss your specific location &mdash; we&rsquo;ll always give you a straight answer on coverage and lead time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you polish and seal the marble in my Glasgow school during the holidays?",
    a: "Absolutely &mdash; school-holiday marble restorations are one of our specialities, particularly across Glasgow City Council, Edinburgh City Council, Aberdeen City Council, and Dundee City Council estates. School holidays give us the 7-14 day window we need to fully strip, refinish, and cure marble in corridors, halls, classrooms, and dining areas without disrupting classes. We work to APUC framework pricing for Scottish local authority contracts and provide all PVG, RAMS, COSHH, and insurance documentation in advance. References from recent school projects available on request.",
  },
  {
    q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between maintenance polish, full polish-and-seal, and mechanical polishing near me?",
    a: "Scrub-and-recoat (&pound;4/m&sup2;) is the quarterly top-up &mdash; light scrub with red pad and neutral cleaner, 2 top-up coats of polishing compound, 12-hour cure. Extends polish life by 6-12 months. Full polish-and-seal (&pound;12-&pound;18/m&sup2; depending on solids content) is the annual cycle for high-traffic marble &mdash; full restoration back to bare tile, 4-6 coats of high-solids polish, 24-hour cure. High-speed polishing (from &pound;1.50/m&sup2; per visit) is the daily, weekly, or monthly gloss-restoration programme &mdash; 1500-2000 RPM with hogs-hair pad relevels the polish and restores the &ldquo;wet-look&rdquo; shine. We&rsquo;ll recommend the right approach at the free floor analysis.",
